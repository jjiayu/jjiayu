### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am Jiayi Wang. 

ðŸ˜„ I received my PhD degree in robotics ðŸ¤– from The University of Edinburgh and I am currently working as a Research Associate (PostDoc) at the same institution.

ðŸ”­ My research focuses on multi-contact motion planning and control for complex scenarios, e.g., uneven terrain locomotion, and loco-manipulation.
