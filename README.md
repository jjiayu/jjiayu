### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am Jiayi Wang. 

ðŸ˜„ I received my PhD degree in Robotics ðŸ¤– from the University of Edinburgh and I am currently working as a Research Associate (PostDoc) at the same institution.

ðŸ”­ My research focuses on developing real-time motion planning and control algorithms for complex multi-contact motions, e.g., uneven terrain locomotion, loco-manipulation.
